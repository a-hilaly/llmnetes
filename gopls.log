This continues until all\n// functions in the executing goroutine have stopped, in reverse order. At\n// that point, the program is terminated with a non-zero exit code. This\n// termination sequence is called panicking and can be controlled by the\n// built-in function recover.\n//\n// Starting in Go 1.21, calling panic with a nil interface value or an\n// untyped nil causes a run-time error (a different panic).\n// The GODEBUG setting panicnil=1 disables the run-time error.\nfunc panic(v any)\n\n// The recover built-in function allows a program to manage behavior of a\n// panicking goroutine.

If recover is called outside the deferred function it will\n// not stop a panicking sequence. In this case, or when the goroutine is not\n// panicking, recover returns nil.\n//\n// Prior to Go 1.21, recover would also return nil if panic is called with\n// a nil argument.
